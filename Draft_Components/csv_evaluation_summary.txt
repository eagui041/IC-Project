### SMART Goal
The goal was to evaluate a CSV file to ensure it contains specific columns that meet the updated requirements of your project. The final criteria were:

1. Minimum Temperature (`Min Temp (°C)`)
2. Maximum Temperature (`Max Temp (°C)`)
3. Precipitation (`Total Precip (mm)`)
4. Year (`Year`)
5. Month (`Month`)
6. Day (`Day`)

### Progress
- Initially evaluated a CSV file (`climate-daily.csv`) but it didn't meet all the original criteria.
- Updated the project requirements twice based on your feedback.
- Successfully evaluated a new CSV file (`en_climate_daily_ON_6105976_1927_P1D.csv`) against the revised criteria.

### Findings
The new CSV file meets all your updated criteria. It contains data ranging for the year 1927, months 1-12, and days 1-31. Temperature and precipitation data are also present and variable.

### Next Steps
- You have the option to merge this data with other yearly files.
- Further data analysis can be performed based on your project needs.
