SMART Goal Summary
------------------
Goal: To generate Python code in a file called 'main.py' that reads data from 'appended_weather_data.csv', 
filters it based on the conditions in 'sealer_requirements.csv', and stores the filtered data in a DataFrame.

Progress So Far
----------------
1. Examined the structure of both 'appended_weather_data.csv' and 'sealer_requirements.csv'.
2. Determined the filtering conditions based on 'sealer_requirements.csv'.
3. Successfully filtered the DataFrame 'appended_weather_data.csv' using Python code.
4. Generated and saved the Python code in a file named 'main.py'.

Code Adjustments
----------------
Adjusted the specific block of code to replace '0' with a variable called 'noras_zero':

# Filtering conditions from 'sealer_requirements.csv'
noras_zero = 0
min_temp_condition = sealer_requirements_df['Min_Temp'][noras_zero]
max_temp_condition = sealer_requirements_df['Max_Temp'][noras_zero]
total_precip_condition = sealer_requirements_df['Total_Precip'][noras_zero]
