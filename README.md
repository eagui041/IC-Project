# Introduction
Homeowners often engage contractors to apply driveway sealers to enhance and protect their driveways. A successful and long-lasting sealer application is contingent on strict adherence to installation specifications, particularly weather conditions. Respecting these conditions is crucial, not only for product performance but also to uphold any warranties.

My Question: Based on historical weather data from the past 100 years for Ottawa, Ontario, in which months are there the most days that meet the ideal conditions for installing driveway sealer? The conditions are set in the product_req.csv file, currently as: days with temperatures ranging from 10°C to 38°C and zero precipitation.

This script allows a user to visualize the average opportunity months and days to install a given product based on the requirements within product_req.csv.
The program generates averages based on 100 years of weather_data, from Environment Canada.
